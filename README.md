## How It All Started
This project is the result of a shared enthusiasm for web development and a desire to put our online course knowledge into practice.
We decided to start from scratch because we believe that the best way to learn is by doing!

## Collaboration in Action
One of the defining aspects of this project was the collaborative effort between us.
Working as a team allowed us to combine our strengths, share insights, and problem-solve together. 
We aimed not only to create a functional application but also to adhere to the best practices in software development. 
This collaborative approach fostered an environment of continuous learning and improvement.

## Lessons Learned
- **Talk, Talk, and Talk!**
  
  Talking to each other is super important. We realized that misunderstandings happen a lot, so keeping the communication clear is a game-changer.

- **Starting from Scratch is Tough**
  
  Going from following online courses to starting something from zero is way harder than we thought. It taught us to really understand what we're doing, not just copy-pasting code.

- **Deploying is a Different Game**

  Taking our project live showed us a whole new world. It's not just about coding; we had to figure out networking, DNS stuff, containers, and all that. A lot more than the local "just works on my machine" setup.

- **Next.js is a Game Changer**

  Trying out Next.js for the first time was like entering a new universe in web development. It made us rethink how we build websites, but in a good way.
